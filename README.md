# iCrop
## iCrop is an intelligent system which intends to assist farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow depending on the sowing season, his farmâ€™s geographical location, soil characteristics as well as environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall.

## Novelty

- Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site-specific parameters.
- The selection of crops & cropping system plays a major role in improving the productivity and profitability of the farmers. 
- Crop recommendation system helps farmers during this decision making process by considering various parameters such as temperature, rainfall, and seasons and agro-ecological situations.
