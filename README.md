# iCrop
## iCrop is an intelligent system which intends to assist farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow depending on the sowing season, his farmâ€™s geographical location, soil characteristics as well as environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall.

## Novelty

- Based on a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data and suggests the farmers the right crop based on site-specific parameters, also known as Precision agriculture.
- The selection of crops & cropping system is a important factor while aiming to enhance the profitability and productivity  of the farmers.
- iCrop helps farmers during this decision making process by considering various parameters such as NPK and pH levels of the soil, rainfall and agro-ecological situations.
